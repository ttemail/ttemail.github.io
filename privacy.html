          <h5>4. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>
          <p>
            Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information
            described above will depend on the personal information concerned
            and the specific context in which we collect it.
            <br><br>
            However, we will normally collect personal information from you
            only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a
            contract with you; (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate
            interests and not overridden by your rights; or (iii) where we
            have your consent to do so. We have a legitimate interest in
            operating our Services and communicating with you as necessary to
            provide these Services, for example when responding to your
            queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the
            purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.
            <br><br>
            In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect
            personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal
            information to protect your vital interests or those of another
            person.
            <br><br>
            If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a
            legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make
            this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the
            provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as
            well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your
            personal information).
          </p>
          <h5>5. SECURITY</h5>
          <p>
            ExtensionsGod is committed to protecting your information. To do so, we
            employ a variety of security technologies and measures designed to
            protect information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
            The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security
            appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.
            However, please bear in mind that the Internet cannot be
            guaranteed to be 100% secure.
          </p>
          <h5>6. DATA RETENTION</h5>
          <p>
            We retain personal information we collect from you where we have
            an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to
            provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with
            applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).
            <br><br>
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
            personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if
            this is not possible (for example, because your personal
            information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
            securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
            further processing until deletion is possible.
          </p>
          <h5>7. ACCESS</h5>
          <p>
            If you are a registered user, you may access certain information
            associated with your Account by logging into our Services or
            emailing help@extensionsgod.com If you terminate your Account,
            any public activity on your Account prior to deletion may remain
            stored on our servers and may remain accessible to the public.
            <br><br>
            To protect your privacy and security, we may also take reasonable
            steps to verify your identity before updating or removing your
            information. The information you provide us may be archived or
            stored periodically by us according to backup processes conducted
            in the ordinary course of business for disaster recovery purposes.
            Your ability to access and correct your information may be
            temporarily limited where access and correction could: inhibit
            ExtensionsGod's ability to comply with a legal obligation; inhibit
            ExtensionsGod's ability to investigate, make or defend legal claims;
            result in disclosure of personal information about a third party;
            or result in breach of a contract or disclosure of trade secrets
            or other proprietary business information belonging to ExtensionsGod or
            a third party.

            8. YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS UNDER THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION
            REGULATION (GDPR)

              In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal
              information, ask us to restrict the processing of your personal
              information, or request portability of your personal
              information. Again, you can exercise these rights by emailing

              You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we
              send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on

              information with your consent, then you can withdraw your
              consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect
              the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your
              withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal
              information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds
              other than consent.
